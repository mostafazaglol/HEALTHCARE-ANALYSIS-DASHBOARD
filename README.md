# HEALTHCARE-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD


● In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority.


● In this Power BI Project, we’ll explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat.


● We’ll analyze attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences.


● We’ll use DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations : 
1. Total Hospitals     2. Total Surgeons    3. Total Discharges   4. Average LOS Days   5. Average LOS Days ALL
 

● To finish off, we’ll bring it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team.
